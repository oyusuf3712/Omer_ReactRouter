        <p>Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed design and the art behind it. I was always fond of art, seeing the outcome of something that wasnâ€™t there before and being a part of it. Throughout high school I always enjoyed my art classes, it was where I would run free creatively and still be correct. In my spare time, I also practice photography.
I possess certification in user experience design, and I am currently enrolled in the interactive media design program to leverage my knowledge and experience into a role as a UX/UI or graphic designer. In 10 years, I would hope to start my design agency, become an expert in my practice and be in a place where I can mentor others..</p>
